🎯 Problem Statement
In telecom, acquiring a new customer costs 5–10× more than retaining one. With a 26.54% churn rate across 7,043 customers, identifying at-risk customers before they leave is a critical business need. This project delivers a complete predictive solution — from raw data ingestion to stakeholder-ready dashboards.
